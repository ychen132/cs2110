	/** Have McDiver find the ring in the sewer, in as few steps as possible. <br>
	 * Once the ring is found, return from method find in order to pick it up. <br>
	 * If McDiver continues to move after finding the ring rather than returning, <br>
	 * it will not count. If McDiver returns from this function while not standing on top <br>
	 * of the ring, it counts as a failure.
	 *
	 * There is no limit to how many steps McDiver can take, but McDiver will receive<br>
	 * a score bonus multiplier for finding the ring in fewer steps.
	 *
	 * At every step, McDiver knows only the current tile's ID and the ID of all<br>
	 * open neighbor tiles, as well as the distance to the ring at each of <br>
	 * these tiles (ignoring walls and obstacles).
	 *
	 * In order to get information about the current state, use functions<br>
	 * getCurrentLocation(), getNeighbors(), and distanceToRing() in FindState.<br>
	 * McDiver is standing on the ring when distanceToRing() is 0.
	 *
	 * Use function moveTo(long id) in FindState to move to a neighboring tile <br>
	 * by its ID. Doing this will change state to reflect McDiver's new position.
	 *
	 * A suggested first implementation that will always find the ring, but <br>
	 * likely won't receive a large bonus multiplier, is a depth-first walk.
	 *

	/** Get McDiver out of the sewer within a certain number of steps, trying to <br>
	 * collect as many coins as possible along the way. Your solution must ALWAYS <br>
	 * get out before using up all the steps, and this should be prioritized <br>
	 * above collecting coins.
	 *
	 * McDiver now has access to the entire underlying graph, which can be accessed<br>
	 * through FleeState. currentNode() and getExit() return Node objects of<br>
	 * interest, and getNodes() returns a collection of all nodes on the graph.
	 *
	 * Look at interface FleeState.<br>
	 * You can find out how many steps are left for McDiver to take using function<br>
	 * stepsToGo(). Each time McDiver traverses an edge, the steps-to-go are<br>
	 * decremented by the weight of that edge. Coins on a tile will be automatically<br>
	 * picked up when moveTo() moves McDiver to a destination node adjacent <br>
	 * to your current node.
	 *
	 * McDiver must return from this function while standing at the exit. Failing to <br>
	 * do so within the steps left or returning from the wrong location will be <br>
	 * considered a failed run.
	 *
	 * McDiver will always have enough time to get out using the shortest path from <br>
	 * the starting position to the exit, although this will not collect many coins. <br>
	 * For this reason, using Dijkstra's to plot the shortest path to the <br>
	 * exit is a good starting solution.
